<meta name="description" content="There are three months passed after David Beckham come back to Real Madrid&#39;s squad, and during those days, No. 23 of Real Madrid played lots of great games which causes the coach of England decided to take him in. Then, I would like to say, it is nothing to proud of David Beckham, because he earn a highest salary from the club and he should and could be the most contributor. And he just come back to the old days which he serviced in MU, act as a best player in the midfield. Let&#39;s go to the point of this blog entry: he is a real man. Just because he fight like a soldier. He asked the coach to join the game with the pain in his left leg, and even has been hurted again, he still insist to complete the game, and everybody who watching this game has found that his stride became jerky; he no longer seemed capable of walking without staggering! What his has done just a real man will do. And, I bring my respect and good wishes to him. Wish he realizes the objective - go to the US with the cup of the league. Keep fighting with pain" />
