<meta name="description" content="After 54 months, we decided to buy a new PC, because current used PC has become unstabled and has been confirmed as a hardware issue. Here comes my solution: Hardware: CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo E6320 MainBoard: GIGABYTE P965-DS3 (rev. 3.3) Memory: Geil DDR2 800 1G * 4 Harddisk: Seagate 320G Graphics: nVidia G8600GT Software: OS: Microsoft Windows Vista Business 32-bit (Unactived version) Develop Tools: Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Professional SDK: Microsoft SDK for Vista + DirectX 10 SDK Anti-Virus: NOD32 2.7 trail version Unfortunately, 32-bit Windows can not support 4G well, it can only display as 3.5GB. So, I will switch to 64-bit OS soon. However, the feeling of Vista is great except the UAC, I am tired to click OK button again and again to allow a special program to run, even the program is shiped by the OS. PS. It is so luck that the price of memory has raisen." />
