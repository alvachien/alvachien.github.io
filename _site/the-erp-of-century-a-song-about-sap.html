<div><strong>Song Lyrics:</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Chorus
S A P
We're gonna be
The ERP
Of this century
(repeat)

A little initiation
An account with no inflation
It's the break down of creation
And the state of the SAP nation

In April 1 of 1972
Five crazy cats sprung the rung from the big blue

It all started with finance
Made some cash, made you dance
Grabbed some focus like a trance
Eventually you'd do business in France

And the rest of the world, one by one,
Knockin' 'em out, until it was all done
R/2, R/3 and now we're talking mySAP
What's next? What will it be?

Chorus

It's a new crew at the top but stop and don't drop
The lead that succeeds from the seed of 72
Not talking to me, but you know I'm talking to you

Now we got Suites, xApps, Manufacturing and Analytics,
Taken business mobile and still wowin' the critics
Yo, back to that Suite, you got the beat under my feet
CRM, PLM, SCM, and SRM – heck you got more M's than Eminem

And now your strivin' to be thrivin' with a
Win in the SMB
Yo, SMB, whatchew gonna be?
The next hit, the next r/3?

And NetWeaver, you best believe 'er
She's bringin' it together cleaner than Beaver Cleaver

Chorus

All right, let's get real about how we really feel
That Oracle deal, a big spin of the wheel
Like Russian roulette, Larry took a big bet
And now it's Peoplesoft and JDE that the world'll forget

Jetzt ist sie weg
Und wir sind wieder allein, allein
Sie ist weg

Yeah, whatever Oracle
We'll take care of your peeps over here

Chorus

One last thing, a little shout out
D' you think we're gonna leave our friends in HCM out?
Naw, yous the grooviest bunch of cats in the hat
And the 'kode thinks your phat, and we like it like that

Yo, SAP, we be hipper than Flea in the Peppers of Chili
We can take the load, just give 'er to the 'kode
And together we'll watch your new business explode</div>
