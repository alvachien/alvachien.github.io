<h1>Good bye, Schumi; Good bye, Beckham!</h1>

<p class="view">by alvachien</p>

<p>After a great show in Brazil, Schumi retired. From now on, we can only see Schumi’s driving from the videos.
Let me write a little more about Alonso, it is hard to say, because he is also a fans of Real Madrid, and next year he will join Malaren team, during the meantime, our company is a sponsor of Malaren team; so, congratulation to he anyway.</p>

<p>It seemed that David Beckham has decided to leave Real Madrid. I respect of he just for his professional character as a soccer player, I know a lot of person don’t like him, but focus on the aspect of him as a soccer player, his success built on hard-working, which should never to be skipped. But by now, he lost his site in the team, for the limitation of his feature, perhaps back to England will be a better choice. Anyway, good luck to him.</p>

<p>I am the one who always perfer the genius who depended on the hard-working to the genius by gift. 
It is true that you can not change some things which the God given, such as your face, your family, but you can change the other things by youself to reach your target. God is fair to every one, if he didn’t give you one thing special, he must has given you another thing as replacement already. And, God never forget to give you a short cut, that is, you can find out another person who can help you to get the success immediatly<img src="http://alvachien.spaces.live.com/mmm2006-09-13_01.00/rte/emoticons/smile_regular.gif" alt="" /> .</p>

<p>Yeah, right, so you know what I mean, enjoy every day as your wish.</p>
