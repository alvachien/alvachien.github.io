<h1>Do you IE8 today?</h1>

<p>It seemed that the software giant in Raymond has waken up. So that it only took about 1 year for the Internet Explorer to upgrade from 7 to 8, however it cost more than 4 years for IE to upgraded from 6 to 7.</p>

<p>Regarding this, I think we should bring our many thanks to Firefox, though I don’t think it is better choice than IE yet.</p>

<p>When people has been forced to face with challenges, they always prefer change. Such like Canon, when Nikon fight back in 2007 and take the no. 1 site of DSLK seller from Canon in Japan, Canon decided to change. Though I don’t know the exactly models will be released till now, I am quite sure that Canon press the successor of EOS 5D in 2008.</p>

However, it's still exists a pity, that is, Real Madrid has been kicked out from Champion League again this morning!
