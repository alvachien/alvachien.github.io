The limitations of Microsoft JET Engine: 1. No 64-bit supported, even the plan. But I am doubtful about the fact that Microsoft won&#39;t publish 64-bit Office? 2.

Offer the T-SQL similiar syntax. 3. Do not support Stored procedure, however the Microsoft JET Engine supports a very simple version which called Query. 4. The Synchronization Services for ADO.NET give me so many pleasantly surprised, but it&#39;s very hard to use it directly: 4.1 No existed demo for using this library to synchronize two SQL Compact database tables 4.2 No funcationality for synchronize two database tables which not located in same PC beside using Web service solution 4.3 To fit the library requirement, that are lots of changes (unrecoverable) should be done upon the current design, the risk is high. 5.
