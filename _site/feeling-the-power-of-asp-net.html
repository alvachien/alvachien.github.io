<meta name="description" content="After I have put a month to study the C# under the .Net Framework 2.0 and have writen a Windows Form version P.I.H., I am satisified with current status, and the GP of C# is great, and C# is powerful tool and much more easier than C++, but it still low performance in execution, maybe upgrade my notebook is one of best solutions. Then, I put my attention to ASP.Net now, it is quite different with the Web dynpro technology based on SAP Netweave platform, but, Microsoft document is full and easy-use than SAP&#39;s, so it is very easy to find out the documents which you need, even some special problems need solved by myself still. However, SQL Server 2005 Express edition is a free tool and fit all my requirements as a tool to do exercises, and ADO.Net support all functionalities too. Anyway, SAP Netweave is just a platform for SAP system, ASP.Net is the only weapon which is developed by Microsoft, and it stands for a weapon which must fight against the Java system. 5 years goes by... From C++/STL/MFC/COM/DirectX To: C#/FCL/ASP.Net/ADO.Net and, ABAP/SAP/Web dynpro So, what is the next?" />
