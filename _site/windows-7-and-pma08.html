<h1>Windows 7 and PMA08</h1>

Some snapshot of Windows 7 have been published in the Internet several days ago. I am not so excited with the new coming Windows OS, but excited in the information which has published with the new OS as well: <strong>Windows 7 (Version 6.1 or 7.0?)</strong> will be the last Windows OS which shipped with 32-bit solution offered by Microsoft.

I know that Microsoft has prepared the 64-bit solution for Windows OS when they building <strong>Windows 2000</strong> <strong>(Version 5.0)</strong>. Though the 64-bit version of Windows 2000 didn't been published yet, Microsoft bring us the 64-bit version of <strong>Windows XP</strong> <strong>(Version 5.1)</strong>. And from then on, Microsoft offers the 32-bit and 64-bit both for the further release of Windows OS, such as <strong>Windows Vista (Version 6.0)</strong>.

However, it seemed that Microsoft should still working a little bit hard on 64-bit software solutions, for example, <strong>Office Suite</strong> and <strong>Visual Studio</strong> have no 64-bit solution till now. And the other big software companies have done less effect on that, such as <strong>SAP</strong>. 

Another thing which also interesting those days is the coming <strong>PMA08 in Las Vegas</strong>. How many new <strong>Canon DSLR models </strong>will be published this time? The rumors in lots of forums have more detail parameters of the replacement of <strong>5D</strong>, as well as the successor of <strong>400D</strong>. And, I also interesting in the new Canon lens as well.

Then, let's wait.
