<h1>Let's talking about Tencent and it's QQ again</h1>

<p class="view">by alvachien</p>

<p>I do remember I wrote an article about Tencent and it’s poor IM - QQ months ago, you can review my old post: “珍惜生命, 远离QQ”. However, I have to admit that I wrote that article just because the worst using feedback from it’s software.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the latest &lt;CBN weekly&gt; using “Penguin’s mistake” as its Cover Story. I totally agree that the points in that article, especially in the following words “The target customers of QQ are all between 18 to 25”. I think I am too old  to bear the poor behavior of QQ and have no interesting of it’s QQ zone, QQ show as well. I guess the QQ show is a typical Tencent’s way to collect money, they just ask his costumers to pay for GIFs or Flash, so funny, isn’t it?</p>

<p>I have asked myself for years: why there are no huge software company in China. Why we can’t own our Microsoft, our own SAP? I think they must be various reasons for our software companies can’t grow biggest among the world. But I do know, if our software company still woking as Tencent way, we won’t have our own Microsoft till the industry of software is disappeared.</p>

<p>I do not want Tencent to close or to shut down, I do hope Tencent to come back a normal way, just as the cover story said.</p>
