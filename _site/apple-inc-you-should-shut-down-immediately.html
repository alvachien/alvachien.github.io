<meta name="description" content="Apple Inc. got a quickly increasement in year 2006, and, they even design another product iPhone. Abviously they want to copy their success from portable music player to the mobile phone. I am the guy who buy a iPod in year 2004, during those time, Apple&#39;s IPod is very expensive, and owns a few market place in China. But I was regret to buy the product from Apple, because the iPod is very hard to use: must using iTunes to handle over the songs; the remote controller must buy by yourself; and iPod even didn&#39;t support a USB interface (iPod Generation 3). Let&#39;s take more attention about the iTunes (because I also developing software). Just like the OS from Apple, iTunes owns a very good-looking UI and leak usage. See the photo below, here comes the bugs which I can not bear anymore: (1). 3 years ago, the iTunes 4 owns a problem when add music folder into &#39;Library&#39;, the name of the song can not be read properly. 3 years is passed, now the version of iTunes is 7, the problem is still. That means to add a hierarchy song&#39;s folder you must select the songs by yourself before the iTunes read the right information. (2). It is still impossible to export the songs from iPod into iTunes. I guess the Apple hates China mobile very much, because China mobile insists to collect the money bidirectional, and Apple keep the data only from iTunes to iPod. (3). The installation of iTunes is quite rude, for it merages the QuickTimes which I won&#39;t used for any case. (4). The installation of iTunes will also add several entries of registry which will cause its application component runs when OS started. And there are no selection for user to make a decision, anything will be done until you remove it one by one. So, Apple Inc. will you mind to shut down as soon as possible?" />
