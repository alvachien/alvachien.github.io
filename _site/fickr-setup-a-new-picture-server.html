<meta name="description" content="Regarding the new picture server, I guess the amount of pictures have exceeded the capability of the old two servers, so Flickr (perhaps it&#39;s better to call it Yahoo) setup a new picture server, and all the new-added photo works fine now ! That&#39;s great, right? But when can the old two servers would be kicked off from the black-list of our party? Anyway, Currently I am doing very hard to do the post-process (via Photoshop CS3 which I just solved the install issue on Vista system) upon the photos in Sanya, as well as the photos of Accenture&#39;s Badminton match. In additional, there also some poor quality photos of Andy Lau&#39;s Concert (because my lens maximum length only to be 105 * 1.6, and I can not offer a VIP site). PS, the concert of Andy Lau is totally a different style of Jacky Zhang&#39;s. As all known, the Jacky Zhang own a better voice, but Andy Lau is a better actor and he was very good at raise the atmosphere of the audience. Also that Andy Lau&#39;s team prepare several better exciting ideas than Jacky&#39;s.
