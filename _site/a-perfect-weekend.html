<meta name="description" content="1. Ferrari win in Australia, the first F1 race of 2007! 2. Real Madrid win! 3. HIH Client 1.0 is released! HIH Client is an application which come from PIH project, built on Microsoft .Net Framework. I took six months to do the movement, from MFC (PIH built on MFC, using C++) to FCL (ADO.Net, Form programming, etc.). And, proud to say, I am an experienced .Net programmer now, after finished 100,000 lines of C# codes. Major features of HIHClient: Using Database file instead of self defintion data format. High security of file, the encryption module written in C++ still. Supports all (almost?) database collection, because I realized two types of connection: SQL Server and OleDb (Access, Oracle, whatever)... Search functionality, you can search everything. Intergated more modules, as it name says &#39;Home Information Hub&#39;, such as Books, Movie, Discs have been added. New UI module (Fish Ren&#39;s Word: Coool!), based on a free component Krpton Toolkit. More powerful options, lots of Configurable Objects, configure it as you will. Multi-languages, as PIH does. But it supports switch languages dynamically. More Extensive, supports plug-in application.. User access control, as PIH does. Multiple users as previous version. However, I never know when will HIHServer be created? In original schedule there exists an ASP.Net based web application, using the same database module as HIHClient used, can be published to internet or intranet both. Now, the plan has been changed, in next phase, I will pause the development of HIH project (sure, small enhancements and bugs fixed on HIH Client will be continued), and I will put more time into book reading / photographing / body building...
