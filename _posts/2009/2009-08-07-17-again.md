《17 Again》无疑是一部西方流行的“麦当劳式”电影，剧情、摄影都那么似曾相识，看到开头就似乎见到结尾。通常对于这种片子，偶没有太多的Comments，就像吃顿麦当劳不需要评价其汉堡、薯条的口味一样。
然而，其中一段台词很不错，没有做父亲经验的Writer应该写不出来，记录一下：
 
> When you're ready to take the love and turn it into a baby,
because that's what love is.
It's that first moment when you hold your baby girl,
and you didn't know that anything could be so small or so delicate,
and you feel that tiny heart beat,
and you know that you couldn't love anything more in the whole world.
And you hope that you can do right by that little girl,
and always be there to catch her when she falls,
and that nothing ever hurts her,
not a broken arm, or a bad dream, or a broken heart.


 
是为之记。
