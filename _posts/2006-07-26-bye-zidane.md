CCTV will prepare another video for the France top star - Zidane in next Monday after they got a video for Begkamp this Monday.
 
As the video beginning, it's time to say good bye. We say good bye the greatest player - Zidane, the owner of 5 in Real Madrid, and the owner of 10 in France national team.
 
And, thinking of the Red Card in the final match of World Cup 2006, I will support Zidane fully, not only because he is my favorite football player, but also because to protected family member is a instinct as a man.
 
However, I still cannot figure it out that the next year's Real Madrid team without Zidane. Maybe a lot of guys think that Raul stands for the White Club, but I always think Zidane is the one, the only one who are not only worth while of the white cloth, but also worth while for the honor '**the best club in 20th century**'.
 
Bye, Zidane, even it is paining to say so...
