Poor guys will buy the cheapest thing. And it is just about me.

Christmas day, 25.12.2006, Monday, it is so great that our company service this day as a holiday even located in China. Though I am alone in home, I also decided to buy some thing special to celebrate the holiday. And I find out the best solution will be buy equipments to upgrade the PC which is bought several years ago. Though it is quite a little bit investment, I had to take the replacement step by step.

It is easily to choose the parts for the first round, for I won't buy CPU and MB, Intel's Core 2 Duo is great but it is expensive and its price will jump down in Q2 2007. So only the accessors are available. As usual, the 'Face Engineering' is bringing into the front. And, in that afternoon, I put 3 hours in the shop before I return home with my new Acer AL2216W.

(See more Acer AL2216W detail information in <a href="http://global.acer.com/products/monitor/1_series.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span></a>. As I put a largest respect to Acer Ferrari Notebook Series, Acer also owns Ferrari Series Monitors. Unfortunately, the Ferrari Series Monitors are not available in China Market).

It returns unbelievable effect when compare the new monitor with my old 15" LCD, even I have used Dell 20" LCD in office after 1 year. And I have to admit, I choose this product just because it is cheapest product among all 22" LCD products.

After enjoying an good Christmas Evening along with new Monitor, I found out the speaker is somehow works unstable. So, let's put the happiness together, yesterday afternoon I go to shop again and bring home a new speaker - Creative TX230. Even I have bought Apple's iPod as Portable Media Player, but it just a result from the choice between Apple and Creative. It is amazing product to me because it owns not only the low price but also its functionality: a wired control and supports headset!

2007 is coming; Vista is coming ...
