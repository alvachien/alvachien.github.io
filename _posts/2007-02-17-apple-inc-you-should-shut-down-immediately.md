<div id="bp-C678F199F470A1FB_798-content">
<div>Apple Inc. got a quickly increasement in year 2006, and, they even design another product iPhone. Abviously they want to copy their success from portable music player to the mobile phone.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am the guy who buy a iPod in year 2004, during those time, Apple's IPod is very expensive, and owns a few market place in China. But I was regret to buy the product from Apple, because the iPod is very hard to use: must  using iTunes to handle over the songs; the remote controller must buy by yourself; and iPod even didn't support a USB interface (iPod Generation 3).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Let's take more attention about the iTunes (because I also developing software). Just like the OS from Apple, iTunes owns a very good-looking UI and leak usage. See the photo below, here comes the bugs which I can not bear anymore:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>(1). 3 years ago, the iTunes 4 owns a problem when add music folder into 'Library', the name of the song can not be read properly. 3 years is passed, now the version of iTunes is 7, the problem is still. That means to add a hierarchy song's folder you must select the songs by yourself before the iTunes read the right information.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>(2). It is still impossible to export the songs from iPod into iTunes. I guess the Apple hates China mobile very much, because China mobile insists to collect the money bidirectional, and Apple keep the data only from iTunes to iPod.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>(3). The installation of iTunes is quite rude, for it merages the QuickTimes which I won't used for any case.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>(4). The installation of iTunes will also add several entries of registry which will cause its application component runs when OS started. And there are no selection for user to make a decision, anything will be done until you remove it one by one.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, <strong>Apple Inc. will you mind to shut down as soon as possible?</strong></div>
</div>
