<div>2006, must be a year which always standing on the contrary side.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>During World Cup 2006, all the teams which I will perferred to have been defeated, such as England, Brazil, France...</div>
<div>Kaka has decided to stay at AC Milan in this season...</div>
<div>In the Champion League, Real Madrid was defeated by Lyons again, with a result 0:2, a discreditable result...</div>
<div>Zidane decided to retire...</div>
<div>Schumi decided to retire...</div>
<div>Beckham lost his site, a professional soccer player has been refused by his country and his club both...</div>
<div>Owen can not back till next year...</div>
<div>Now, Schumi lost the Japan race, and the 8th champion must has been gone...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When I was a child, I has been told that a real man will be stronger when they has been defeated, and will stand up on the same site where they fell. But who can tell me, how can the Schumi won the champion back again before his retirement?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>PS. Though there are too many games' result beyond my expectation, but I didn't bet on them.</div>
