<div>Several years ago, I have tried my best to find out this book, but I only got a electric book via the internet. It's is obvious not every book worthwhile for me to do this. During the past years, I have read a lot of books, there are several classical books, such as &lt;Write Secure Code&gt;(Microsoft Press), &lt;Refactor&gt;, &lt; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201657880/qid=1078285070/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-0782244-3415801?v=glance&amp;s=books"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">Programming Pearls</span></a>&gt;, they are all taste great, and, I looking forward to this book &lt;Code complete&gt; now.</div>
