Got the book - **Code Complete (2nd Edition)**, I will focus on this book for several weeks, and will update my notes in to [Alva Chien's CSDN Blog](http://blog.csdn.net/alvachien) as soon as possible.
 
Several years ago, I have tried my best to find out this book, but I only got a electric book via the internet. It's is obvious not every book worthwhile for me to do this. During the past years, I have read a lot of books, there are several classical books, such as *Write Secure Code* (Microsoft Press), *Refactor*, *Programming Pearls*, they are all taste great, and, I looking forward to this book *Code Complete* now.
 
Got a perfect book to read, just like talking with an excellent friend, smell delicious and taste great!
