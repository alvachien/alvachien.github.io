The day before yesterday, I got an interview in HP for a suitable position. I am not sure about HP can give me an offer, but I just try. During the processing of the interview, I found the guy who are doing interview to me is very depth in the technologies which I always be proud of, such as C, Windows 32 platform. In the viewpoint of those guys, Linux is a same one as UNIX and Windows, for there are all load the file(executable) into memory and then got the address of code and parameters and RUN it, it is so similar in all OSs. But to me, it is to hard to explain the format of PE structure and find the bugs only by the error status report of the CPU and memory status. And, I don't know how long it will be caused for me to being so professional like him.

And, about the English, in the pasting 4 days I got 4 interviews, all by English. It is not easy to me, even I try hard to make communications, and I'm sure I have made great process in my oral expression already, but it seemed that a long way is still waiting for me even now. Yes, I can have a conversation with my English currently, but sometimes it is UGLY.

I think it is easy to find out your object, target, and your dream, but it is hard to get it, why? Everybody knows word hard is the key feature to get success, but I think, the most important thing should be how to stick to work hard until you reach it. Right?
