It seemed that the software giant in Raymond has waken up. So that it only took about 1 year for the Internet Explorer to upgrade from 7 to 8, however it cost more than 4 years for IE to upgraded from 6 to 7.

Regarding this, I think we should bring our many thanks to Firefox, though I don't think it is better choice than IE yet.

 When people has been forced to face with challenges, they always prefer change. Such like Canon, when Nikon fight back in 2007 and take the no. 1 site of DSLK seller from Canon in Japan, Canon decided to change. Though I don't know the exactly models will be released till now, I am quite sure that Canon press the successor of EOS 5D in 2008.
