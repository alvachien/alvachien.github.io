Real Madrid 5-1 Dynamo Kyiv!

We are walking on the way to the 10th Champion League Cup, the major opponent - FC Barcelona also fighting for their the 3rd Champion League Cup too. And, in the October 2006, a match will be arranged between this two top clubs in Spanish.

A Classical Song: **We are the Champion**

I've paid my dues, time after time;
I've done my sentence, but committed no crime;
And bad mistakes,
I've made a few,
I've had my share of sand.
Kicked in my face,
But I've come through,
And I need to go on and on and on and on...

We are the champions - my friend,
And we'll keep on fighting till the end,
We are the champions,
We are the champions,
No time for losers,
'Cause we are the champions of the world!

I've taken my bows,
And my curtain calls,
You've bought me fame and fortune,
And everything that goes with it,
I thank you all,
But it's been no bed of roses no pleasure cruise,
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race,
And I ain't gonna lose,
And I need to go on and on and on and on...

Put the end to this entry, maybe retirement will be a better solution for David Beckham...
