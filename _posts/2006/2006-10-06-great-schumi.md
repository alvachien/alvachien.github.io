Long holiday, long trip.

The only thing which excited me is Schumi win Shanghai Race which holded in 1st October. Though it has been happened 6 days ago, but I returned home at the same day, and could not access the internet till this morning at QinDao airport, Asus free PC demo station, I got the message, Schumi won the Shanghai Race finally.
