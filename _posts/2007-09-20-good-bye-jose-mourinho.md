<div>Jose left Chelsea in quite a sudden.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Jose has a word: "God. After god, me!". But unfortuately, the fact turns out: after God, there is another man called BOSS.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have no other word to say, but I think his left also took the last reason to watch the matches of England league, of course, from my side only. Also personally, I hope he can join Real Madrid.</div>
