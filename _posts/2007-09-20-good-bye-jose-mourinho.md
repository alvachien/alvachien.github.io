Jose left Chelsea in quite a sudden.

Jose has a word: "God. After god, me!". But unfortuately, the fact turns out: after God, there is another man called BOSS.
 
I have no other word to say, but I think his left also took the last reason to watch the matches of England league, of course, from my side only. Also personally, I hope he can join Real Madrid.
