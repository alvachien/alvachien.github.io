Some snapshot of Windows 7 have been published in the Internet several days ago. I am not so excited with the new coming Windows OS, but excited in the information which has published with the new OS as well: **Windows 7 (Version 6.1 or 7.0?)** will be the last Windows OS which shipped with 32-bit solution offered by Microsoft.

I know that Microsoft has prepared the 64-bit solution for Windows OS when they building **Windows 2000** **(Version 5.0)**. Though the 64-bit version of Windows 2000 didn't been published yet, Microsoft bring us the 64-bit version of **Windows XP** **(Version 5.1)**. And from then on, Microsoft offers the 32-bit and 64-bit both for the further release of Windows OS, such as **Windows Vista (Version 6.0)**.

However, it seemed that Microsoft should still working a little bit hard on 64-bit software solutions, for example, **Office Suite** and **Visual Studio** have no 64-bit solution till now. And the other big software companies have done less effect on that, such as **SAP**. 

Another thing which also interesting those days is the coming **PMA08 in Las Vegas**. How many new **Canon DSLR models** will be published this time? The rumors in lots of forums have more detail parameters of the replacement of **5D**, as well as the successor of **400D**. And, I also interesting in the new Canon lens as well.

Then, let's wait.
