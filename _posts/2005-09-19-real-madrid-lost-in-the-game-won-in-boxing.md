**Disappointed!**

Real Madrid lost their all three games in eight days. But after the third game, their lost the game with a result of 0:1, David Beckham, owner of the No. 23, the top star of the Real Madrid, won a boxing game in the rest room. And, he lost all four games in the pasting fortnight, in the first game, he stands for the England, as a caption, their lost the game, and lost their gentle both, Rooney, as all known as the furture football star, hardly to self-control to begin a fight with Beckham. And, the last game, Beckham has been very angried for the the competor's illegal  attack, so, he decided to fight back, and he won the boxing, however.

It sounds funny, isn't it?

But, what's the matter with the Real Madrid?

I just puzzled.
