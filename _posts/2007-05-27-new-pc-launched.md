<div id="bp-C678F199F470A1FB_912-content">
<div>After 54 months, we decided to buy a new PC, because current used PC has become unstabled and has been confirmed as a hardware issue.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here comes my solution:</div>
<div><strong>Hardware</strong>:</div>
<div>CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo E6320</div>
<div>MainBoard: GIGABYTE P965-DS3 (rev. 3.3)</div>
<div>Memory: Geil DDR2 800 1G * 4</div>
<div>Harddisk: Seagate 320G</div>
<div>Graphics: nVidia G8600GT</div>
<div><strong>Software</strong>:</div>
<div>OS: Microsoft Windows Vista Business 32-bit (Unactived version)</div>
<div>Develop Tools: Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Professional</div>
<div>SDK: Microsoft SDK for Vista + DirectX 10 SDK</div>
<div>Anti-Virus: NOD32 2.7 trail version</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Unfortunately, 32-bit Windows can not support 4G well, it can only display as 3.5GB. So, I will switch to 64-bit OS soon. However, the feeling of Vista is great except the UAC, I am tired to click OK button again and again to allow a special program to run, even the program is shiped by the OS.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>PS. It is so luck that the price of memory has raisen.</div>
