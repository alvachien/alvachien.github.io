<div id="bp-C678F199F470A1FB_249-content">
<div>I have writen a article &lt;Impossible is Nothing&gt;, now, I just try to write another, with the name &lt;Regret is Nothing&gt;, but after think it over, I decide to use the name as the article is used.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Time is going by when I got the training in <strong>SAP Labs China</strong>, new technology, new environment, new company, new workmates, and new route selected to go to work. Sometimes, I will feel sorry about the things I selected, just like <strong>SAP Labs China</strong>, there are a big gap between my anticipatory and the fact, in a word, feel losting, and I can not point it out which reason cause this, and as I discuss the topic with<strong> Esther</strong>, in my mind, maybe <strong>Microsoft </strong>is a better selection for me.  I am shocked by my theory, and I tried to find it out why. <strong>SAP Labs China </strong>will not support a suitable position for the person who engaged for new technique, and hunger for the core mechanism of a successful system, in contrast, there are rich in logic, and only business logic.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Esther will give me the bigest support as usual. But I should not feel regret at all, I make the decision for the direction change, and I make a lot of preparion for it. Fighting with the lost feeling, a battle between me and myself, just like the advisements of Nike. No C++ any more, no technique accumlation any more. Same as the new employee, neck byneck, to start the new trail together, so, forget the C++ or the other technqiue which I proud of before, fighting for a new field -- business logic.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As is ment in my previous article, the key of success is stick to your own decision, hold it on, and keep it, so, you can get the success as you wish. I do <strong>NOT </strong>think a person's success depends on the future he/she owned, however, I think it only depends on the target he or she working for. Get it, success, otherwise, lost.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, Regret, as well as Impossible, means nothing to a winner, and it will be a good friend of the loser usually.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>P.S. Today, after missed three phone calls, I got the last one, there is another HR from <strong>SAP Labs China</strong>, working for another group, asking me to attend a interview, I cannot image it out when I told her I already a member of <strong>SAP Labs China</strong>^_^.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Let's end of this entry, I missing the days with long hair, maybe I should recur the pattern again, and why not?</div>
