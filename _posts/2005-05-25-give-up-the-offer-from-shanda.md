Today, I have given up the offer by ShanDa, but, I have make several mistakes with it.

First, I got a worst reason to explain why. I tell them that I can't agree with ShanDa's salary and the career for me at all, I'm looking forward to system analysist, but they only supply a software engineer position. It is proved to a worst reason soon. The manager from ShanDa who called me said, you will get promotion and higher salary soon if you can prove your ability. So, I have to say sorry to him, if I only care about higher salary, I have taken a part in the other famous corporations already(*the only except case which didn't give me an offer letter after support me a chance to interview is [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), and the key of this case is my poor English oral expression,in fact, I have a poor english writting too*).

Second, I should be more strongly, that means, I should to let he make selection, give me what I want or not. But I'm hesitate to do it. It seemed that not only the English oral expression, but also the Chinese oral expression I should to spend times to enhance it.

[ShanDa Networking](http://www.snda.com/), a famous corporation for its network games, and now it cost a lot of person and times to develop a new platfrom used for digital home solution, such as video player, HD TV, network games, and so on. But, as is discussed by the IT watchers, ShanDa making a bet on 2 years for it's digital home solution, because network games is growing to a period of narrow margin of profit now.

*Esther comfort me as the words "Forget the ShanDa, it is only a China inland Corportion, you have given up a lot of companys, and some of them are much better than ShanDa. and there are a lot of better companys ahead still...".Thank you very much.*
