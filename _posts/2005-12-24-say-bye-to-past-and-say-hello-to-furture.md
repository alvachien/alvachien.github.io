12.24, Christmas Eve, and it can be counted by fingers to work out the days left before the new year.
 
As a tradition of chinese, I have to summarize the past year and prepare the plan of the next year too. Year 2005, a lot of changes, in a word. However, Real Madrid can not find a way out still, the archenemy - Barcelona FC - got an increditable enhancement contrastively; Ferrari only got the third, and Michacel Schumacher lost the champion. 

And, me, turned to another direction, and I could not find it out whether the result is right or not till now, also I'm not sure whether I will turn it back in the furture or not, because being a developer of Microsoft is still an honor in my heart.
 
About the next year, anyway, welcome. I hope the coming days will be passed by easily. The rhythmicity of Shanghai is so quick and bring us too many pressure, so do a little more slower.
 
Less requirement and less desire, more smile and more happiness...
