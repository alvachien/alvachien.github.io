<div id="bp-C678F199F470A1FB_1346-content">
<div>It seemed that there are always lots of things need to do.</div>
<div>It also seemed that there are always lots of books need to go through.</div>
<div>It still seemed that there are always lots of exericses need to be started.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I do remember I wrote 'Time Management' in my SCORE. Now I do think it's correct because I do need to synchronize all those requirements which I can't arrange them smoothly, and the result turns out is that I only to play WAR3 instead of start any of those tasks. Nevertheless, it do helps a lot on my WAR3 skills.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But, it still need to change from the heart. Specifically for some private reasons. To achieve more, you should do more. I guess that's the exactly reason why Nike beats Adidas, when Adidas singing "Impossible is Nothing", the Nike "Just Do It"!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, Just Do It.</div>
</div>
