It seemed that there are always lots of things need to do.

It also seemed that there are always lots of books need to go through.

It still seemed that there are always lots of exericses need to be started.


I do remember I wrote 'Time Management' in my SCORE. Now I do think it's correct because I do need to synchronize all those requirements which I can't arrange them smoothly, and the result turns out is that I only to play WAR3 instead of start any of those tasks. Nevertheless, it do helps a lot on my WAR3 skills.


But, it still need to change from the heart. Specifically for some private reasons. To achieve more, you should do more. I guess that's the exactly reason why Nike beats Adidas, when Adidas singing "Impossible is Nothing", the Nike "Just Do It"!

 
So, Just Do It.
