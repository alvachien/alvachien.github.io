About two weeks ago, we arranged a travle of **WuXi** city, including all the members of my family (my parents, Esther and me), and, of course, with our new weapons, **Sony T7** for Esther and **Panasoinc FZ30** for me^_^.
 
Preparation of tickets, search the hotel, set the calendar...  lots of fussy tasks (therefore, a special thank to Esther, hard work and excellent work too). But, there are still somethings left beyond our plan, that is **weather**. It is flurry during our arrival, and we began our journey from **Lake Tai and Garden Yuan Tou Zhu**.
 
However, after we finished a simply lunch in a temple with vegetable noodle, the rain began hard, we had to complete our scheme with a little hurry.
 
The second day, the rain stopped, but another problem occured - it became very cold, and we were planned to  a small hill climbing. To fight against the worse weather, we accomplished our task successfully. And, I selected a famous restaurant in **WuXi City** to celebrate this, which named as **Zuang Yuan Lou**. Esther said that it was cheaper than her budget. How to explain her word? Did her mean to come to **WuXi city** again just for the 'cheap' lunch or ?
 
And the second afternoon, we went to the last destination which listed in Esther's calendar. CCTV has invested millions dollars to build **San Guo City**, **Shui Hu City** and **Tang City**, so, we paid the most expensive tickets than all others sights in WuXi city, and, in return, only dispoint except the show before we left, they played a special scenario of the San Guo period, **Lv Bu** fight against the **Liu/Guang/Zhang **brothers, and I felt a little regret because I didn't take the DV with us.
 
So, where will be the next destination?
Madrid or ...
