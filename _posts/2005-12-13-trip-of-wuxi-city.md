<div>About two weeks ago, we arranged a travle of <strong>WuXi</strong> city, including all the members of my family (my parents, Esther and me), and, of course, with our new weapons, <strong>Sony T7</strong> for Esther and <strong>Panasoinc FZ30</strong> for me^_^.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Preparation of tickets, search the hotel, set the calendar...  lots of fussy tasks (therefore, a special thank to Esther, hard work and excellent work too). But, there are still somethings left beyond our plan, that is <strong>weather</strong>. It is flurry during our arrival, and we began our journey from <strong>Lake Tai and Garden Yuan Tou Zhu</strong>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>However, after we finished a simply lunch in a temple with vegetable noodle, the rain began hard, we had to complete our scheme with a little hurry.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The second day, the rain stopped, but another problem occured - it became very cold, and we were planned to  a small hill climbing. To fight against the worse weather, we accomplished our task successfully. And, I selected a famous restaurant in <strong>WuXi City</strong> to celebrate this, which named as <strong>Zuang Yuan Lou</strong>. Esther said that it was cheaper than her budget. How to explain her word? Did her mean to come to <strong>WuXi city</strong> again just for the 'cheap' lunch or ?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And the second afternoon, we went to the last destination which listed in Esther's calendar. CCTV has invested millions dollars to build <strong>San Guo City</strong>, <strong>Shui Hu City</strong> and <strong>Tang City</strong>, so, we paid the most expensive tickets than all others sights in WuXi city, and, in return, only dispoint except the show before we left, they played a special scenario of the San Guo period, <strong>Lv Bu</strong> fight against the <strong>Liu/Guang/Zhang </strong>brothers, and I felt a little regret because I didn't take the DV with us.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, where will be the next destination?</div>
<div>Madrid or ...</div>
