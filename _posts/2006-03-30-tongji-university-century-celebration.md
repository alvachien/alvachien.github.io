**TongJi University Century Celebration** is coming [1907-2007]!
 
For some all known reasons, **TongJi University** was falling down since year 1952, and its site is replaced by another school which is near by **TongJi university**.
 
Anyway, TongJi University is my Alma Mater, I hope it can own its previous reputation back -- one of the two best universities in Shanghai city, of couse, the other one is **JiaoTong University**.
 
Inspiring motto of TongJi:
**<span style="font-size: medium;">严谨，求实，团结，创新</span>**
 
The spirit of TongJi:
**<span style="font-size: medium;">同心砥砺,同窗求索,为振兴中华而读书;</span>**
**<span style="font-size: medium;">济困扶危,济世兴邦,为强国富民而奉献!</span>**
