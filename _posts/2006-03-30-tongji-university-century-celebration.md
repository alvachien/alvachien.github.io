<div><strong>TongJi University Century Celebration</strong> is coming [1907-2007]!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For some all known reasons, <strong>TongJi University</strong> was falling down since year 1952, and its site is replaced by another school which is near by <strong>TongJi university</strong>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, TongJi University is my Alma Mater, I hope it can own its previous reputation back -- one of the two best universities in Shanghai city, of couse, the other one is <strong>JiaoTong University</strong>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Inspiring motto of TongJi:</div>
<div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">严谨，求实，团结，创新</span></strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>The spirit of TongJi:</div>
<div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">同心砥砺,同窗求索,为振兴中华而读书;</span></strong></div>
<div><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">济困扶危,济世兴邦,为强国富民而奉献!</span></strong></div>
