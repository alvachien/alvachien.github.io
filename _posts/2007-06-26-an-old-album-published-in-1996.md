The envelope

The old album -  **我感觉不到你**, by **巫启贤**, EMI Taiwan published in 1996, which was suddenly been recalled in the deep night, and I can not help searching around the search engine to get all songs downloaded.
 
Put the headset on, turn the volume a little bit lounder, shut all the lights, surrounding with the dark, and the my heart following the rhythm, fly back to the last year of my high school, the classmates, the friends, the teachers, the classroom, laugh and tears, the days without fear...
 
Just write down the lyric of my favorite song in this album:
*答应我好好的过*
曲:巫启贤 词: 王中言
 
隔着车窗看着你的眼, 无声的告别了昨天,
我们将走进孤单的黑夜, 谁也没有再多说些什么,
不约而同的挥挥手, 还给了对方温柔的自由;
 
疯狂的笑过也哭过, 可是谁愿意见好就收?
用微笑结束的承诺, 不是不痛是不能够....
 
答应我好好的过, 别再为爱受折磨,
爱过的的没有谁能抢走, 这一点你我都想通;
 
答应我好好的过, 对与错何苦追找究?
去占有, 去执着, 去享受, 拥抱那曾失落的自我,
活得洒脱 活得洒脱...
 
By the way, according this experience, among the music file aspect of the searching engine, ![Sogua](http://www.sogua.com/) still be the best one, and ![Yahoo Music](http://music.cn.yahoo.com/) will be much better than ![Baidu Map3](http://mp3.baidu.com/) in the old songs.
