Yesterday I have to have my hair cut because my mum ask me to do so, and she will choose this topic to discuss in the phone each time, I surrounded.

But, Esther said that I looked to be a little younger with the short hair as before.

I didn't update my MSN Space about one month. It seemed that a lot of things have happed and disappeared, such as Real Madrid went to China, earn a lot of money but lost the heart of its fans. I still remember the focus of a beautiful girl - a fan of David Beckham - shout David Beckham's name with the loundest voice, just went to cause the big star's attention. Obviously, she failed, and her hurted her throat while the big star leave China and went to Japan with his classic, sunny smile on his face.

Before write down this blog entry, I have reviewed my old articles, I shamed for a lot of plan are not finished yet, such as .Net review, STL learning, etc.

Anyway, go ahead.

A new style, a new begining...
