Regarding the new picture server, I guess the amount of pictures have exceeded the capability of the old two servers, so **Flickr** (perhaps it's better to call it Yahoo) setup a new picture server, and all the new-added photo works fine now !
 
That's great, right?
But when can the old two servers would be kicked off from the black-list of our party?
 
Anyway, Currently I am doing very hard to do the post-process (via **Photoshop CS3** which I just solved the install issue on Vista system) upon **the photos in Sanya**, as well as **the photos of Accenture's Badminton match**. In additional, there also **some poor quality photos of Andy Lau's Concert** (because my lens maximum length only to be 105 * 1.6, and I can not offer a VIP site).
 
PS, the concert of Andy Lau is totally a different style of Jacky Zhang's. As all known, the Jacky Zhang own a better voice, but Andy Lau is a better actor and he was very good at raise the atmosphere of the audience. Also that Andy Lau's team prepare several better exciting ideas than Jacky's. :smile:
