In fact, I had decided to read more books instead of written so many codes (mostly in C# now). However when I finished the travel to Nanjing, I can not help myself to write another application again - I need a reciter application to record any word or sentence anywhere.

 
Then, I began to design this new application immediately, and implement it via the .NET framework as HIH does, actually, I choose the same IO part as HIH does. I have to admit that now I am much more familiar with C# than C++, because I only cost 2 weeks to finish the main framework (spare time only). And of course, during this period, I still keep reading the <CLR via C#>, and put the new-learned knowledge inside my development as well. And several technical understanding have put into the articles in here: [CSDN Blog](https://blog.csdn.net/alvachien)

 
The main feature of ACReciter Beta 1.0:

1. Multiple users supported
2. Minize into the tray icon supported
3. Data file encryption supported
4. Prunciation record and play supported (need DirectX 9.0c or upper version assemblies)
5. Level management supported
6. Selection management supported
 
I won't put lots of other features inside this product, because I think it works well now. That means I won't add the multiple-languages support, Office-style UI, etc. But I will embed other languages sturcture if it's required, such as Japanese, German.
