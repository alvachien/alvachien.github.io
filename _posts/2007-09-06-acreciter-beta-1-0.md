<div>In fact, I had decided to read more books instead of written so many codes (mostly in C# now). However when I finished the travel to Nanjing, I can not help myself to write another application again - I need a reciter application to record any word or sentence anywhere.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Then, I began to design this new application immediately, and implement it via the .NET framework as HIH does, actually, I choose the same IO part as HIH does. I have to admit that now I am much more familiar with C# than C++, because I only cost 2 weeks to finish the main framework (spare time only). And of course, during this period, I still keep reading the &lt;CLR via C#&gt;, and put the new-learned knowledge inside my development as well. And several technical understanding have put into the articles in here: <a href="http://blog.csdn.net/alvachien">http://blog.csdn.net/alvachien</a> </div>

<div>The main feature of ACReciter Beta 1.0:</div>
<div>1. Multiple users supported</div>
<div>2. Minize into the tray icon supported</div>
<div>3. Data file encryption supported</div>
<div>4. Prunciation record and play supported (need DirectX 9.0c or upper version assemblies)</div>
<div>5. Level management supported</div>
<div>6. Selection management supported</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I won't put lots of other features inside this product, because I think it works well now. That means I won't add the multiple-languages support, Office-style UI, etc. But I will embed other languages sturcture if it's required, such as Japanese, German.</div>
