<div id="bp-C678F199F470A1FB_351-content">
<div>Real Madrid lost the game in King's Cup with the scrore 1:6, <strong>a discreditable result</strong>!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It seemed that they not played with soccer, but within a tennis game. All of the players in Real Madrid earn a higher wage, <strong>Beckham</strong>, <strong>Zidane</strong>, where are you? And, <strong>Ronaldo</strong>?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After the closest cup is disappeared again, it seemed that Real Madrid will won nothing during this season the third times. Change the coach again? It is amazing, why not sell the <strong>Ronaldo</strong>? And why not vote for a new <strong>chairman</strong>, do put more money on the defences to take place of the current one who only put attention to buy the attacks and midfields?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Disppointed but looking forward to the fight against <strong>Arsenal </strong>still...</div>
</div>
