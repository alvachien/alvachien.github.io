BAR has been kicked off from the Champion League by the MU last night, which means their lost the last chance to own one kind of championship this season.

Is it quite similar as RMD two seasons ago? I think so. There are lots of SUPERSTARS in BAR, but they miss the championships.

From my point of view, I hope RMD can win the coming match this weekend, so that BAR must show their respect to the new champion, that means the players of BAR will lines up in formation greets to the players of RMD!

**WHITE is greatest for merging colors, RED/BLUE just part of it!**

*BAR stands for Barcelona. MU stands for Manchester United, RMD stands for Real Madrid.*
