> We were one man down and our players never stopped proving their courage, drive and winning character. It was lovely to witness their reaction. I am very proud of them and I'm sure our fans are too. You can never think this team is out of a game because it is capable of achieving impossible things. Today's was an heroic victory and we should be happy for that. We must now celebrate this title, especially because it is the first time in 18 years we win two consecutive leagues. We will depart for Madrid as soon as possible and once we arrive we will go straight to Cibeles. The proper celebrations will take place when we are officially given the title.
- Said by Ramón Calderón, Chairman Of Real Madrid
