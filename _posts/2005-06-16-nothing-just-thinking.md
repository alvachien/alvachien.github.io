I'm preparing for the coming next week, to prove myself and to get a new starting.

I have selected to stay in ShangHai instead of some places which my parents and relations ask me to, I only wish everything which belongs to me are all earned by myself. To dress with a cloth with trademark is Adidas or Nike? OK, the only way is that you must work hard for higher salary. **Words are easier than actions**, and this way is proved to be very hard, sometimes, I always thinking of a little poesy as below, for relax or for somethings else I cannot express it out with my poor English:

**自立歌**
*陶行知*

滴自己的汗，
吃自己的饭，
自己的事情自己干，
靠天靠人靠祖上，
不算是好汉。
