England is going home, so as Brazil.
 
All the teams what I think will go forward for next step are defeated, and now, I think Germany can get a good score in World cup, so, be careful, Germany.
 
Agentina, please do not stop crying...
England, defeated by the goalkeeper of Portugal...
Brazil, has been killed by Zidane!
 
Zidane, always my favorite socceer player, so, I also wish the French can going a little more advance in the coming matches, and got a gift for Zidane's retirement.
 
Let's say good bye to Robert Carlos, David Beckham, who will never attend the World Cup anymore.
