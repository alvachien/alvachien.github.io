<div>England is going home, so as Brazil.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All the teams what I think will go forward for next step are defeated, and now, I think Germany can get a good score in World cup, so, be careful, Germany.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Agentina, please do not stop crying...</div>
<div>England, defeated by the goalkeeper of Portugal...</div>
<div>Brazil, has been killed by Zidane!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Zidane, always my favorite socceer player, so, I also wish the French can going a little more advance in the coming matches, and got a gift for Zidane's retirement.</div>

<div>Let's say good bye to Robert Carlos, David Beckham, who will never attend the World Cup anymore.</div>
