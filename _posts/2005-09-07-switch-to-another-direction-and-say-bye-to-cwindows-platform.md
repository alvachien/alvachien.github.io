Finally, I have changed my direction of career, give up the C++ and windows development, to star up a new phase of my career life.

It is hard for me to say bye to the technologies which I have used for several years, and I can not forget the days which used for to learning those knowledge. Today, I am 25 years old, so I have encouraged to do such a big change, 5 or 10 years later, I am not sure that I can do it again.

Put an end to this article, good bye : C/C++/C#/MFC/ATL/WTL/COM/DirectShow/FCL/Linux...
