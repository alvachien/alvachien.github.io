I always confused with the locations for Actions and Scripts, especially after upgrade the Photoshop or even the OS.

For Scripts, saved it in Program Files.

In Windows 7, the folder is, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS4\Presets\Scripts.</span>
Note that, the name in Menu will be the name of the script without extension.

For Actions, the program will loaded automatically from the folder below:

In Windows 7, the folder is, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">C:\Users\{User Name}\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS4\Presets\Actions</span>.
The actions will be loaded automatically during the startup of Photoshop. However, the actions won’t display it in Action panel. When click the context menu of Action panel, the actions on that folder will be added as a menu item per actions.  See following:
