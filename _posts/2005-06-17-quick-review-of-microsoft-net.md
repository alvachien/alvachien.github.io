As I explained in my articles earily, I have to stop the review process of C++ and STL, instead, I must put all my attention to Microsoft.Net platform.

Here, it comes:

(I) <a href="http://blog.csdn.net/alvachien/archive/2005/06/17/396538.aspx">Basic Concepts of .Net Framework and C#</a>
(II) <a href="http://blog.csdn.net/alvachien/archive/2005/06/19/398056.aspx">Basic Concepts of ASP.Net, Web Controls and WebService etc.
</a>(III) Coming soon...

====================================
Postscript:
Somebody give me a suggestion to hide my MSN Space, but I don't want to do that. In this blog, I will write down some articles about what my thinking, about my currently status, maybe mean nothing to the others, but it's just mine. And, I hope the articles of technologies, such as DirectShow, C++ or .Net, maybe helpful to you.
