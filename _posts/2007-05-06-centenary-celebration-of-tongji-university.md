20 May, the Centenary Celebration of TongJi University will start.
 
Yesterday (5 May), I visit the campus in a short tour, and bought several souvenir for keeping the memory.
Nevertheless, I wish TongJi University can back to top 10 universities as soon as possible. As a graduated student of TongJi university, I will bring all my thanks to her, and all my respects.
 
**同心同德同舟楫，济人济事济天下！**

**同窗求索，同心砥砺，为振兴中华而读书；**
**济困扶危，济世兴邦，为强国富民而奉献！**
