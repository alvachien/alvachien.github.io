<div>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! And the coming Chinese Festival ^_^.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I will give my special thanks to <strong>Esther </strong>who made the visit counter in My MSN Space, it looks great. And announce the thanks to Microsoft, Visual studio 8 tastes great too, except the compatibility in Visual C++.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The last one, to make a foresee of the next year, I only wish the plan of 2006 will be accomplished, less pressure, more exciting</div>
